      <description>Calabrian blood and cosmopolitan soul, I grow up with a consolidated technical training in university environment studying Information Engineering and Cinema and Media Engineering.
There are, however, innumerable stimuli and inspirations of an artistic nature along the way, to the point that I decided to join these two souls by choosing to become a Technical Artist.
What I do is therefore dedicate myself to the creation of tools that through digital technologies allow artists to best express their potential.</description>
